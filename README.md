# 📧 Email Spam Detector

A Machine Learning-based **Email Spam Detection** web app that classifies emails as **Spam** or **Not Spam** using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. It helps users quickly identify unwanted or fraudulent messages with high accuracy.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Detects whether an email is **Spam** or **Safe**
- Uses **Machine Learning** and **Natural Language Processing**
- Clean and simple **web interface**
- Instant predictions without reloading the page
- Shows model accuracy and performance metrics

---

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Pandas & NumPy**
- **NLTK**
- **Streamlit** (for web app)
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** (for visualization)

---

## 🧩 How It Works
1. The text data is preprocessed (stopword removal, stemming, etc.)
2. Features are extracted using **TF-IDF Vectorization**
3. A **Machine Learning model** (e.g., Naive Bayes or Logistic Regression) is trained
4. The model predicts if a given email is spam or not
